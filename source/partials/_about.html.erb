        <h2>Hi, I'm Anju.</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Full Stack Web Developer based in Japan. I am fluent in English and in Japanese, so feel free to contact me with your confort language.
          I graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo in December 2021 and am currently looking for a job.
          Before I jumped into the developer world, my carrier was in hospitality.
          I'm a mother of two adorable daughters; 3 years old and 1 year old. I play the piano but currently I don't own it, but I'm looking foward to teach my babies how to play.
          I love the ocean, ships and scuba diving!
