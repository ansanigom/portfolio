          <h2>Hi, I'm Anju.</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Full Stack Web Developer based in Japan. I am fluent in English and in Japanese, so feel free to contact me with your preferred language.
            I graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo in December 2021 and am currently looking for new opportunities.
            Before I jumped into the developer world, my career was based in hospitality.
            I'm a mother of two adorable daughters; 3 years old and a 1 year old. I play the piano but currently I don't own one, but I'm looking foward to teach my babies how to play.
            I love the ocean, ships and scuba diving!
